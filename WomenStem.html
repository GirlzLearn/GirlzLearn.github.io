                  STEM, short for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, is composed of a vast
                  universe of career oppportunites that have proven to be vital in our society today. In our
                  generation, the title, STEM has become quite the buzzword among students, countless with an
                  interest to pursue these fields. According to Cyberstates, in US alone, there are around
                  12.31 jobs in the tech-related workforce. Over the past year, over 300,000 jobs were added in
                  tech. However, less than 20% of these jobs are occupied by women. Although the number of women
                  in science and engineering is growing, men continue to outnumber them, especially at the higher
                  levels of these professions. </p>
                  <h3>Girls' Interests in Math and Science Are Shaped by Their Environment</h3>
                <p>
                  This article discusses the effects of societal beliefs and the learning environment on girls’
                  achievements and interest in science and math. A finding shows that when teachers and
                  parents tell girls that their intelligence can expand with experience and learning, girls do
                  better on math tests and are more likely to say they want to continue to study math in the future.
                  That is, believing in the potential for intellectual growth, in and of itself, improves outcomes.
                  This is true for all students, but it is particularly helpful for girls in mathematics, where
                  negative stereotypes persist about their abilities. By creating a “growth mindset” environment,
                  teachers and parents can encourage girls’ achievement and interest in math and science.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Does the stereotype that boys are better than girls in math and science still affect girls today?
                  Research profiled in this report shows that negative stereotypes about girls’ abilities in math
                  can indeed measurably lower girls’ test performance. Researchers also believe that stereotypes
                  can lower girls’ aspirations for science and engineering careers over time. When test
                  administrators tell students that girls and boys are equally capable in math, however, the
                  difference in performance essentially disappears, illustrating that changes in the learning
                  environment can improve girls’ achievement in math.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The issue of self-assessment, or how we view our own abilities, is another area where cultural
                  factors have been found to limit girls’ interest in mathematics and mathematically challenging
                  careers. Research profiled in the report finds that girls assess their mathematical abilities
                  lower than do boys with similar mathematical achievements. At the same time, girls hold
                  themselves to a higher standard than boys do in subjects like math, believing that they have
                  to be exceptional to succeed in “male” fields. One result of girls’ lower self-assessment of
                  their math ability—even in the face of good grades and test scores—and their higher standards for
                  performance is that fewer girls than boys aspire to STEM careers. By emphasizing that girls
                  and boys achieve equally well in math and science, parents and teachers can encourage girls to
                  assess their skills more accurately.
                  <p>
                  One of the largest gender differences in cognitive abilities is found in the area of spatial
                  skills, with boys and men consistently outperforming girls and women. Spatial skills are
                  considered by many people to be important for success in engineering and other scientific fields.
                  Research highlighted in this report, however, documents that individuals’ spatial skills
                  consistently improve dramatically in a short time with a simple training course. If girls grow up
                  in an environment that enhances their success in science and math with spatial skills training,
                  they are more likely to develop their skills as well as their confidence and consider a future
                  in the STEM field
                </p>
                <h3>Bias and Stereotypes Limit Number of Women In Scientific and Engineering Fields</h3>
                <p>
                  Most people associate science and math fields with “male” and humanities and arts fields with
                  “female,” according to research examined in this report. Implicit bias is common, even among
                  individuals who actively reject these stereotypes. This bias not only affects individuals’ attitudes
                  toward others but may also influence girls’ and women’s likelihood of cultivating their own
                  interest in math and science.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not only are people more likely to associate math and science with men than with women,
                  people often hold negative opinions of women in “masculine” positions, like scientists or
                  engineers. Research profiled in this report shows that people judge women to be less competent
                  than men in “male” jobs unless they are clearly successful in their work. When a woman
                  is clearly competent in a “masculine” job, she is considered to be less likable. Because both
                  likability and competence are needed for success in the workplace, women in STEM fields
                  can find themselves in a double bind. If women and men in science and engineering know
                  that this bias exists, they can work to interrupt the unconscious thought processes that lead
                  to it. It may also help women specifically to know that if they encounter social disapproval
                  in their role as a computer scientist or physicist, it is likely not personal and there are ways
                  to counteract it.
                </p>
                  The striking disparity between the numbers of men and women in science, technology, engineering,
                  and mathematics has often been considered as evidence of biologically driven gender
                  differences in abilities and interests. The classical formulation of this idea is that men
                  “naturally” excel in mathematically demanding disciplines, whereas women “naturally” excel in
                  fields using language skills. Recent gains in girls’ mathematical achievement, however,
                  demonstrate the importance of culture and learning environments in the cultivation of abilities
                  and interests. To diversify the STEM fields we must take a hard look at the stereotypes and
                  biases that still pervade our culture. Encouraging more girls and women to enter these vital
                  fields will require careful attention to the environment in our classrooms and workplaces and
                  throughout our culture.
